    "The initialization of both Backpack and Item objects is tested.\n",

    "Adding items to the backpack and checking for capacity constraints is tested.\n",

    "The items setter is tested by adding multiple items.\n",
    "The total_weight and total_value properties are indirectly tested through other tests but not directly tested for their correctness in various scenarios (e.g., with no items in the backpack).\n",

    "The test for adding an item that exceeds the backpack's capacity is present.\n",
    "Validation of items (whether an item is a valid Item object and has positive weight and value) is tested.\n",
    "5. Class Methods:\n",
    "The set_capacity class method is tested.\n",
    "\n",
    "Areas Not Covered:\n",
    "- Direct tests for total_value and total_weight properties to ensure they calculate correctly in various scenarios.\n",

    "2.Avoid Redundant Tests: Ensure that each test case is unique and necessary. For instance, test_add_item_too_heavy and test_add_item both test the addition of items that are too heavy. Consider merging them or ensuring they test different aspects of the functionality.\n",
    "3. Use setUpClass and tearDownClass: If the setup for each test case is the same and the tests do not modify the state of the objects in a way that affects other tests, use setUpClass and tearDownClass methods to perform setup and teardown operations once per class, instead of before and after each test method.\n",
    "4. Mocking External Dependencies: If there are external dependencies or I/O operations (not present in this specific case but useful in general), use mocking to bypass these operations to speed up test execution.\n",
    "5. Selective Test Execution: If the test suite becomes large, consider mechanisms to run only a subset of tests during development, such as tests relevant to recent changes. This can be managed through test tagging or selective test suite execution.\n",
    "6. Parallel Test Execution: Consider running tests in parallel to utilize multiple cores. Python’s unittest framework does not support this out of the box, but you can use third-party packages like nose2 with the --with-parallel option or pytest with the xdist plugin.\n",
